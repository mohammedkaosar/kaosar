                        <p>Creating knowledge by research and then applying it in teaching is one of the
						important reasons I believe we should do research in the university settings.						
						I have been performing active research in the broader area of Information and 
						Communication Technology (ICT) since 2001. I feel successful when I see I am able to 
						teach some knowledge to my students which are created by myself. N-Queen problem is one of
						such a research outcome of mine that I teach in Algorithm Analysis course.</p>
                        
						<p>One of the major areas of my research interest is developing privacy-preserving 
						techniques to overcome privacy and security problems existing 
						in our life. Some of my research works in this area such as, semi-trusted 
						server based secure computation, fully homomorphic encryption system to perform 
						secure arithmetic comparison, oblivious transfer etc. are applicable in solving
						many privacy related problems in cyber security, social networking, cloud computing, 
						data mining etc. I have published a number of quality research papers in reputable 
						journals and conferences including IEEE Transaction on Knowledge and Data 
						Engineering (TKDE), Data and Knowledge Engineering (DKE), IEEE International 
						Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), Journal of Computers, 
						Computer Communication (ComCom) etc. 						</p>
						
						<p>I have experience of working in many research projects. I have worked in 
						two Australian Research Council (ARC) discovery projects as Research Fellow 
						in 2009-2012. I had been a team member for some commercial and academic 
						projects while my work at Research Institute, KFUPM, Saudi Arabia in 
						2007-2008. Currently I have one funded project worthy of USD10000 approved 
						and another one is under review. I am familiar with all the processes 
						involved in research project such as - problem formulation, idea 
						generation, project proposal submission, conducting and managing the 
						project itself, publishing the research outcome etc.</p>
						
                        <p>I am currently focusing on number of research topics to address many unanswered 
						questions. In the area of security and privacy, I am currently working
						on three problems to solve (i) factorizing big integers in an efficient way 
						(ii) developing a multiple/composite secret key encryption system and 
						(iii) developing an efficient fully homomorphic encryption system for all-base 
						number systems. Solution to these three problems will resolve many of the 
						privacy and security related problems existing in ICT, which include, 
						privacy preserving data deduplication, secure third party data outsourcing, 
						securing our existing cryptosystem, eliminating the trusted third-party 
						assumption in security algorithms etc.</p>
						
                        <p>My future research plan will not only solve the problems in the area 
						of computer science but also will address many privacy and security related 
						problems in other disciplines, such as, health services, psychology, farming, 
						military, homeland security, criminology etc. I am quite confident that my 
						research outcome will benefit the research community in my area as well as 
						will help the government to ensure security and privacy in rapidly 
						growing cyber world.</p>
						
                        <p>I have formulated and prepared research plans to accomplish my above 
						stated challenges. I already have published some initial frameworks towards 
						achieving them. Though my recently accepted grant proposal is related to 
						these areas, but due to lack of funds and short project duration, I would not be
						able to go that far to accomplish my goal. Therefore, I am working towards achieving 
						some prestigious research grants, which would allow me engaging some research 
						assistants and graduate students for a long duration. </p>
						
						<p>My current work place is more towards teaching oriented than research. Hence, 
						I was not 
						able to perform much research work last few semesters due to time and other resource
						constraints. I believe if I get opportunity to work in a university 
						that provides enough priority in research, I think I will get more time and other 
						necessary resources for my research. Hence, moving to such a university is a prime 
						need to carry on my research ideas. </p>
						
                        <p>In conclusion, my extensive experience of teaching and research in 
						the field of ICT, publication record of accomplishment, current research 
						activities & collaboration, current and future prospect of my research area 
						and plan to carry on my research are the promising and potential carriers for 
						my research career. I am confidently looking forward to accomplishing my research 
						goals.</p>

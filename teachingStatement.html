                        <p>My love to teach and work with students, to develop educational materials and 
						to enhance & utilize educational techniques are the main reasons for seeking an 
						academic career in university. I believe, seeing students learning should be considered as 
						the main success of a teacher. Appropriate delivery of the course material 
						along with motivation and inspiration from the teachers can facilitate students 
						learn the most effectively.</p>
                        <p>I have been involved in teaching, training and developing educational 
						materials in tertiary level in several universities since 2001. Thus, I 
						have acquired extensive experience of teaching many courses. With a solid 
						foundation in computer science and strong mathematical background, I can 
						teach most ICT and its relevant courses which include but not limited to – Information Security,
						Information System Management, Network Security, Cryptography, Wired/Wireless Networking, Mobile App Development,
						Human Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, 
						Operating System, Algorithm Analysis, Programming Languages etc. </p>
						<p>I have been gathering teaching experience by teaching various courses in 
						many universities in Australia, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh since. I have 
						delivered course materials to diversified student groups such as - graduate, undergraduate, 
						male only, female only, mixed gender, from multiple ethnic and national backgrounds etc.
						I have taught different kind of courses such as - theoretical courses, lab courses, project 
						and development oriented courses, research oriented courses etc.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important key factors which makes the teaching easy is students’
						curiosity and interest for the course material. Unfortunately, not all the students 
						inculcate this value while they are in the classroom. I use various techniques 
						which are discussed later to alleviate this situation. In introductory courses, 
						I feel it is important to teach students how to approach the subject matter. 
						On the other hand, in high-level courses, I think teachers should emphasize on 
						planning, designing, encouraging critical thinking, collaboration and reviewing 
						works.</p>
                        <p>I believe teachers can learn along with students throughout their whole career 
						too. I like to learn from students, colleagues, university administration and other challenging 
						situations. Feedbacks from students and administration can play a key role to improve 
						teaching skill. I believe sound and healthy relationship and interaction between 
						teacher-student and administration can enhance the teaching and learning 
						environment in a university the best. Some of my teaching principles 
						include but not limited to:</p>
                        
						<li style=margin-left:20px><i>Clarifying the goal and objective of the course:</i> At 
						the beginning of the course, I clarify the course objectives and goal to my 
						pupils. Motivation is always the key driving force in learning. Realistic 
						goals and objectives of a subject matter not only motivate students, but also 
						make the course material interesting and easy to understand. To make sure students are aware about
						the introductory course matters sometimes, I conduct a week 0 quiz focusing 
						initial issues such as - course specification, syllabus, topics to cover etc. I also 
						discuss how a particular lesson or topic important to solve a real life problem before 
						starting the lesson. I always try to ensure students learn something from every minute I talk to 
						them. In the beginning of every class, I talk about what we have learned in last lesson 
						to link with the new one. I also try to make sure students are aware about how
						a particular topic contributes to the course-learning outcome. </li></br>
                    <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Involving students:</i> I believe, student's engagement 
					makes the course more interesting and easy to understand. They also 
					feel that, they are important for the lesson, which increases their motivation.
					Very often, I ask students to answer some of the things I had taught. Sometimes I build an
					idea or problem and ask students to solve it. Then I involve everybody in the class
					to discuss the matter in a constructive way. After applying such approach, I have seen significant 
					improvement in some students I am currently teaching. Sometimes I learn some new ideas from students
					when I involved them in class. This is also a great tool that I use to understand 
					my students better.</li></br>
                <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Respecting students:</i> I believe, human respecting another 
				human is not about the position of an individual in. It is about what coming out of the mind of 
				that particular individual. Therefore, I do not expect I will be respected by my students
				just because I am their instructor and I have the authority to assign them some marks. 
				Rather I believe a teacher should respect and welcome a student's particularity. 
				A teacher also should consider every student's need, circumstance and potentiality. 
				I like to talk to each student personally if I feel my advice may motivate him/her 
				to learn the course better. In Effat University I teach female students. They come from 
				a culture that values the honor of the females differently. Here, I felt the need of 
				respecting and being considerate about each student's circumstance. 
				I noticed such philosophy of mine is being appreciated among the students at various occasions.</li></br>
                <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Fair grading policy:</i> I believe, fair and 
						transparent grading policy can make the students more motivating towards 
						the course. However, teachers may not be able to modify the grading policy 
						itself much while working under an administration; at least they can ensure the 
						policy being applied fairly to each student. In postgraduate level, the flexible 
						and fair grading policy can make the course more effective, interesting and 
						realistic.</li></br>
                    <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Letting the students make mistake:</i> I never interrupt a 
					student who is about to make mistake while talking to me or answering a question. 
					I let him finish and then explain where and why he made the mistake. This way he 
					learns better and never makes the same mistake in future.</li></br>
                <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Maintaining office hour:</i> I believe a welcoming and flexible 
				office hour encourages students to talk to his teacher about any course issue. I 
				always maintain such office hour which is completely dedicated for students. I used to 
				maintain such office hour in some universities where it was not mandatory.</li></br>
            <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Using Feedback:</i> I love to analyze the feedback from students 
			and administration. This helps me improving my teaching skill. After every end of a semester, usually 
			we receive student evaluation about the instructor and the course. I carefully look at every individual feedback 
			to determine how I could improve next time. Time to time I also ask my students whether 
			they have any advice about the way I conduct the course. This help me modify my way of teaching
			dynamically.</li></br>
        <li style=margin-left:20px><i>Maintaining administrative policy:</i> I believe maintaining 
		administrative policy in teaching can bring a good outcome to the university. I try my best 
		to be consistent with the university policy in teaching. If I find any strategy unfriendly, I raise 
		the issue to the administration so that it can be fixed for next time.</li></br>
		<li style=margin-left:20px><i>Learning spot:</i> I believe the learning should not be confined 
		within the classroom. I sometimes take my students to some seminars or talks from where 
		they learn new things. Sometimes I take them outside of the university to show them some
		practical applications. I arrange and help student participate programming competitions nationally  
		and internationally. I accompany them during the event. I think those are the perfect moments 
		to pass on some knowledge to my students.</li></br>
